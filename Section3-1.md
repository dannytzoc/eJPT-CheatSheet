## Introduction To Host Based 
+ atttacks are targerted toward a specfic system
+ System Host based attak are use play after you have gained access to a traget network
+ Misconfiguration in OS and inherent vulnerabilites 
+ Much more specialized

## Windows Vulnerabilites 
+ Severe vulnerabilites raninging from Conflicker ato eternal blue
+ Windows OS developed in C programming so BoF
+ By Default is not configured to run securly
+ New Vulenrabilites are not immediatly patched by Microsoft
+ WIndows also vulenrable to cross platform vulnerabilites for example SQL injection
+ Physical attacks like theft
+ Information disclouse - allows attacker to access confidentail data
+ BoF - allow attacker to write data to buffer and ovverun and write data to allocated memory addresss
+ RCE - runs attacker to remolty exeucted code
+ Pirvilege escalte- elevate privilages
+ DoS - allows an attacker to consume a system or host resources


+ TCP 80/443 Microsft IIS Web Server
+ WEBDAV 80/443 TCP allows HTTP extension Update Delte move and COpy
+ SMB 445 Network file shares on LAN network 
+ RDP TCP 3389 GUI remote access protocls
+ WinRM TCP 5986/443 Windows Remote manamgment protocl that can used to remote access to Windows System
